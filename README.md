# CC-FEB-PYTHON_DEVELOPMENT
 This repository is to share my workings as a Python Developer Intern at CodeClause.

##Task1_URL shortener

Description : Use of the Cuttly API is present. To create a new account and use the API, follow these simple steps. After creating an account, I went to "My Account" and clicked on "Edit Account," where I was able to view account details and click on a button to get a new API key (so I can make API requests). To complete, just replace api key with API key(code) and the URL; want to shorten.


##Task2_Alarm Clock with GUI

Description : The alarm project's goal is to use Python to implement an alarm clock. Python has a number of innovative libraries, including datetime and tkinter, that enable me to build projects that use the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface for setting alarms in 24-hour format.


##Task3_Voice Assistant using Python

Description : To create this voice assistant for performing various tasks like accessing files from the device, opening a browser, finding the time, the weather, etc., I used a number of Python modules. The speech recognition module, which is at the centre of the entire project, is one of the main modules. With the help of this, Assistant can hear voice messages, decode them, and also produce vocal outputs.


##Task4_Python Flappy Bird Game

Description : I have used Pygame, a cross-platform collection of Python modules made specifically for creating video games. It includes sound and graphics libraries made specifically for use with the Python programming language.
